            I am a first year software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. My interests
            are in areas of app development. I like the idea of helping the user in his daily life by
            providing a fun and accessible platform to use. I have a passion for artificial
            intelligence and machine learning. And I am pursuing my studies to acknowledge more
            skills.

            I am a first year in software engineering program at the University of Ottawa. The area of
            mobile programming seems very interesting because I think the mobile would be the future
            patern of standart in the following ten years. The web programming is as interesting as
            the mobile because, at the time I write this, unfortunatly, there is a virus pandemic but
            thanks to the web technology, the society is still alive even this fact.

            I am a First-year computer science student at the University of Ottawa. I am quite
            interested in coding, particularly in web and software development. The world nowadays is
            filled with the internet and software; thus, I believe we all relate to each other. Right
            now, I am creating a website for our 'imaginary' application.

            I am a first year software engineering student at the University of Ottawa. At BiteMatch,
            I helped with the designing of the BiteMatch app and website. One of my interests is
            design, as I like making the user experience effortless and easy to use, as well as look
            pleasing to the eye.
