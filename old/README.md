BiteMatch is a food delivery app with a gaming aspect. When two customers order a meal from the same restaurant, they must duel in the form of any minigame available on the BiteMatch app. The loser must pay for both their own and their opponent's meal, whereas the winner pays half of their meal price to any of the  charities available on the app. It's food delivery, gamified.
